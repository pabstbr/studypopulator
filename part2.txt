This application can be secured with some form of user authentication and then tying what participants are visible to that. I'd probably make a many-to-many usersXparticipants table to tie the users and participants to each other and specify who is editable, and who/what is viewable as a whole to them. Or, maybe permission levels so that every new person could just be given a level number that specifies what they're free to do rather than doing it explicitly for every new user. Stricter data sanitization wouldn't go amiss either. The sqlite database could use with some permissioning, as well. It's currently wide open.

I already made a, what I belive to be, small work flow improvement over the initial ask. What I'd likely want to do to further improve this is turn the single participant page into a partial that is hidden behind a dropdown feature in the participant list. For example, have an arrow next to the participant's name that when clicked would expand with the rest of the information. Also AJAX DB requests would be nice, instead of loading the whole page whenever the participant's status is changed just update that information in line. I believe having the new participant entry as its own page helps to keep the workflow feel deliberate.
